1. Examiner

This aplication is a simple e-learning platofrm. It can be used to create online courses, add materials to these courses and decide which student users have acess to which by proxy of student groups that have courses and students attached to them. It also features creation of exams for courses. Examiner users can write questions for exams, which are going to be shown to students in random order. It is possible to write more questions than the amount that will be given to student users (in that case students will recieve only a fraction of all questions prepered). Exams can have single choice questions (radio) or mulitple choice questions (checkboxes). Exams can be given time limits (in minutes) and limited amount of attempts that students can take before failing course (3 by default). Students can then view their results and examiners can view results of all students. One you register platform admin account and e-learning platform is created. You can use that admin account to create examiner and student users, choose logo and so on.
